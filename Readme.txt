# Speech-to-Text Transcription

This script provides a simple web application for transcribing speech from audio files using the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API. It is built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating web apps with minimal effort.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up Google Cloud credentials:
   - Replace `path_to_service_account_key.json` in `transcribe.py` with your own key file.
   - Ensure the necessary permissions are granted for the Speech-to-Text API.

## Usage

To use the app, follow these steps:

1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run transcribe.py
   ```

2. Upload an audio file (MP3 or WAV format) to transcribe.
3. Optionally, specify an accent for improved transcription accuracy.
4. Click the "Transcribe" button to initiate the transcription process.

## Note

- The temporary files created during the transcription process are automatically deleted after use.
